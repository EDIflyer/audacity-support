# Developing your own plugins and scripts

## Plugins

Audacity supports the following formats:

* **Nyquist** (Lisp or SAL)\
  Audacity's built-in scripting format. Allows for easy generation of UI elements and already is tuned to Audacity's needs. Note that this plugin format is not supported as realtime effects.\
  Documentation: [creating-your-own-nyquist-plugins](creating-your-own-nyquist-plugins/ "mention")&#x20;
* **VST3** (C++)\
  The industry standard for plugins. Widely supported across Audacity, Musescore and most DAWs. \
  Documentation: [https://steinbergmedia.github.io/vst3\_doc/vstsdk/index.html](https://steinbergmedia.github.io/vst3\_doc/vstsdk/index.html)&#x20;
* **LV2** (C, C++, other C-compatible languages)\
  The Linux plugin standard. Widely supported across open source software.\
  Documentation: [https://lv2plug.in/book/](https://lv2plug.in/book/)
* **Vamp** (C++, Python)\
  An easy-to-develop-for framework for audio analyzers.\
  Documentation: [https://www.vamp-plugins.org/develop.html](https://www.vamp-plugins.org/develop.html)

Additionally, LADSPA, VST2.4 and Audio Units are supported. LADSPA and VST2.4 are the predecessor to LV2 and VST3, respectively, and thus fairly outdated. Audio Units are only available on macOS.&#x20;

Further, Audacity has modules, which allow extending Audacity beyond just editing audio. It is somewhat experimental and not yet documented.

## Scripts

Audacity supports the following scripting formats:&#x20;

* **mod-script-pipe** (Python, Perl) \
  A module that exposes a named pipe to which commands can be sent. \
  Documentation: [https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/scripting.html](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/scripting.html)
* **Macros**\
  You can use Audacity's macros feature to chain effects and actions together. This can be exported as a file.\
  Documentation: [https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/macros.html](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/macros.html)

If you have found a macro or script which you find universally applicable, you can share it in the scripts section.
